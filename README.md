# string-parsing-calculator
This project is a command-line-based mathematical expression solving scientific calculator implemented in C. The calculator is capable of handling basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions (such as sine, cosine, tangent), logarithmic functions, and exponentiation. The user can input a mathematical expression, and the program parses and evaluates it step by step, displaying intermediate results at each stage. The calculator also supports the use of parentheses to define the order of operations. The implementation includes functions for converting between integers and strings, performing mathematical operations, and handling trigonometric functions. The project provides a simple and interactive way for users to input and solve mathematical expressions, making it a practical tool for basic mathematical calculations.
